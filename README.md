# Bob Lock

**Bob Lock** is a lightweight Fabric mod that redesigns the Minecraft view bobbing experience.
It replaces the vanilla bobbing animation with a modern, smooth hand-lowering effect while moving, completely eliminating screen shake.

## Features

- **Custom Hand Animation**  
  Your hand smoothly lowers when moving and returns when stationary, providing visual feedback without the motion sickness.

- **No Screen Shake**  
  Enjoy the "View Bobbing: ON" setting without the camera shaking up and down.

- **Polished Feel**  
  Includes smooth transitions and a subtle input-based delay for a natural, premium feel.

- **Vanilla Friendly**  
  Works entirely client-side. To disable, simply turn View Bobbing to off in video settings, or disable the mod in the config, to get back Vanilla View Bobbing
